#  Infinities in Probability

In this note I want to try to explain in a bit more of an intuitive sense, what the following theorem means: 

\\[
  \boxed{
  \begin{align}
    \text{Borel Cantelli Lemma :}  \newline \newline
    \text{if} \sum_i^\infty \mathbb{P}(E_i) < \infty \rightarrow \mathbb{P}(\limsup E_i) = 0
  \end{align}
  }
\\]


In english, what this theorem says is that for any sequence of events where the sum of their probabilities is finite, the probability of \\(\limsup E_i\\) must also be zero. To properly explain what that means, we should first explain some elementary but important concepts:
