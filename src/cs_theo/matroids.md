## Introduction


## The Vamos Matroid 

## The matroid secretary conjecture 

A central open question motivating a lot of research in online algorithm design, is what is called the matroid secretary conjecture. The matroid secretary conjecture asks the following - for any set of matroid constraints $\mathcal{M} = (E, \mathcal{I})$, is there an online algorithm which acquires a constant fraction of the optimal weighted basis $I \in \mathcal{I})$? 

There are a bunch of results on restricted matroids - constant factor online approximations are known for graphic, laminar, and transversal matroids. 

Currently, the best known general form algorith is $O(\frac{1}{\log \log r})$, where $r$ is the rank of the matroid

For certain types of matroids 



## Ideas (maybe) worth exploring

- Memory Augmentation: Does relaxing the problem so that we can choose either the current or previous element improve our ability to do well w.r.t to some matroid?
