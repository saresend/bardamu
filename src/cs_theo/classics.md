# Classic Problems

## The Original Secretary Problem 

## The Matroid Secretary Problem

We are given a matroid $\mathcal{M} = (\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{I})$, with nonnegative edge weights $\{w_e\}_{e \in \mathcal{E}}$. Imagine 
for example that these are chosen by some adversary. 

## Prophet Inequality

Basically the matroid secretary problem, but now we assume some things about how the weights are drawn
